# wooify-checkout

The idea is to mimic the checkout pages of that ecomm saas application. I find the biggest issue with WooComm themes is the checkout pages inheiret a lot of styles from their theme, and generally they look shit (aka untrustworthy). This plugin will hide all that stuff and have an opinionated layout.
